Here are some SQL queries with JOIN

SELECT co.country, ca.name, COUNT(i.inventory_id) AS movies
FROM inventory i
INNER JOIN store s ON i.store_id=s.store_id
INNER JOIN address a ON s.address_id=a.address_id
INNER JOIN city ci ON ci.city_id=a.city_id
INNER JOIN country co ON co.country_id=ci.country_id
INNER JOIN film_category fc ON i.film_id=fc.film_id
INNER JOIN category ca ON fc.category_id=ca.category_id
GROUP BY co.country, ca.name
ORDER BY country DESC, movies DESC

SELECT co.country,
MIN (f.rental_duration) AS min_rental_duration,
AVG (f.rental_duration) AS average_rental_duration,
MAX (f.rental_duration) AS max_rental_duration,
MIN (f.rental_rate) AS min_rental_rate,
AVG (f.rental_rate) AS average_rental_rate,
MAX (f.rental_rate) AS max_rental_rate,
MIN (f.replacement_cost) AS min_replacement_cost,
AVG (f.rental_rate) AS average_replacement_cost,
MAX (f.rental_rate) AS max_replacement_cost,
MODE () WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY rating) AS rating_mode
FROM film f
INNER JOIN inventory i ON i.film_id=f.film_id
INNER JOIN store s ON i.store_id=s.store_id
INNER JOIN address a ON s.address_id=a.address_id
INNER JOIN city ci ON ci.city_id=a.city_id
INNER JOIN country co ON co.country_id=ci.country_id
GROUP BY co.country
